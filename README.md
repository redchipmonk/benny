Welcome to my html project. I am making a fanpage of my dog as well as having a form to submit some information of a different dog. In this project, I am hoping to practice some git commits as well as some form elements. This is heavily inspired by freecodecamp's html lessons.

After finishing this project, I would say that I am pretty confident in my html and git committing skills. One thing I really struggled on was creating the form. I realize that the freecodecamp form already has a page for that form, so I had to look up how that was done. Turns out creating the page where the data is requires some JS which I am quite not ready for. I do not want to jump the gun, but this project was very helpful for my html skills.
