Welcome to my html project. I am making a fanpage of my dog as well as having a form to submit some information of a different dog. In this project, I am hoping to practice some git commits as well as some form elements.

After finishing this project, I would say that I am pretty confident in my html and git committing skills. Turns out creating the page where the data is requires some JS which I am quite not ready for. I do not want to jump the gun, but this project was very helpful for my html skills.
